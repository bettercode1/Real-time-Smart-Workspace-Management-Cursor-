Use React Vite and Node and create one userfriendly and good looking dashboard with proper Crud Opertions and Proper Workflow AND Use Following Firebase to do this 
// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
// For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyAqMOqJmDLwaozc_cq5-ZSromfKtf6tFog",
  authDomain: "hotel-management-5cee0.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://hotel-management-5cee0-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "hotel-management-5cee0",
  storageBucket: "hotel-management-5cee0.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "800168036537",
  appId: "1:800168036537:web:b9b72cf54ef39853d0b368",
  measurementId: "G-E8TBL7FHYM"
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const analytics = getAnalytics(app);

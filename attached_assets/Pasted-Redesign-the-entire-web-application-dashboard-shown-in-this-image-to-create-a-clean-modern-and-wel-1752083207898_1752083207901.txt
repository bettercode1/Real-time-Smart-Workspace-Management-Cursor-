Redesign the entire web application dashboard shown in this image to create a clean, modern, and well-aligned UI for both admin and user views.

Requirements:

Modern Look & Feel:
Use a consistent color palette, soft shadows, smooth gradients, rounded edges, and clean typography. Prioritize usability and clarity.

Layout & Alignment:
All elements must be properly aligned and spaced (cards, buttons, headings, icons). Ensure a responsive layout that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Functional Elements:
Ensure every panel (Admin Panel, Live Floor Plan, Booking Management, Analytics, Alerts, Device Status, User Management, Room Setup, IAQ Monitoring, and Settings) contains sample data relevant to the module.

For example:

Live Floor Plan: Render a mock floor map with clickable room nodes.

Analytics & Reports: Include sample charts (bar, line, pie) for user traffic, usage, etc.

Alert Manager: Show alert list with status, date, and severity.

Device Status: List devices with statuses like online/offline.

Dashboard Overview:

Keep core KPIs like Total Users, Room Utilization, Alerts, System Health, but redesign cards to be more consistent in height, padding, and color gradients.

Admin Welcome Section:

Update welcome section with a cleaner design (less visual clutter), and add profile image or icon next to name.

Side Navigation:

Use minimal icons with labels.

Highlight active menu.

Add hover effect and collapsible menu option.

Logout Button:

Place clearly at the bottom, minimal red styling unless it's a warning action.

Performance:
All features should be functionally working â€” connected with a dummy backend or mock Firebase integration for testing purposes.

User Panel:

Provide a cleaner user view with access to relevant data only (remove admin-only elements).

Add sample components like room bookings, recent notifications, or user activity.

Final result should reflect a production-ready design with real component hierarchy and data structure suitable for implementation.

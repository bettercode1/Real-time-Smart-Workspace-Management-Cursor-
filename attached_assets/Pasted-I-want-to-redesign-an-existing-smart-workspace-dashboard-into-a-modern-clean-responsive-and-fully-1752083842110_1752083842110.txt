I want to redesign an existing smart workspace dashboard into a modern, clean, responsive, and fully functional web application using the following features and modules.

This dashboard must have two panels: Admin Panel and User Panel, each with specific permissions, functionality, and views. Please keep the visual design minimal, professional, and mobile-responsive, with components structured for real deployment.

🎯 Core Design Goals:
Clean, modern UI (inspired by tools like Notion, Linear, Vercel)

Neatly aligned elements and consistent spacing

Soft gradients, shadows, rounded corners, and system icons

Dashboard layout with a sidebar and main content

Work well across desktop and mobile devices

Every section should show realistic demo/sample data

✅ V1 Smart Dashboard - Feature Set
🟢 1. Live Occupancy & Environment Monitoring
Interactive Floor Plan View:

Show desks and rooms

Occupancy status via NFC badge/wristband

Color-coded zones (green/yellow/red)

IAQ Display Per Room:

Temperature (°C/°F)

CO₂ (ppm)

Humidity (%)

Live Alerts Panel:

High CO₂

Over-occupancy

No-show alerts

📅 2. Room & Desk Booking
Calendar-style view (day/week)

Book or release rooms and desks

Tap-in/Tap-out via NFC scan (mock log data)

Auto-release desks if no-show after X mins

📊 3. Essential Analytics Dashboard
Occupancy trends (daily/weekly usage)

Top 5 used rooms

Reserved vs checked-in comparison

IAQ trends per room

AI-based room suggestions (sample output view)

🎛️ Admin Panel Functions
Device status monitor (online/offline)

User list with wristband/NFC badge IDs

Room setup (max capacity, labels)

🧩 Suggested UI Components:
Sidebar Navigation (with icons, active state, and collapsible behavior)

Header Bar with profile, alerts icon, and settings

Interactive Floor Plan Map with room/desk highlights

Mini IAQ Widgets per room

Live Alerts Center (top 3–5 alerts only)

Booking Calendar Module (day/week switcher)

Analytics Cards:

Room ranking

Trends (small charts)

System Settings Page (admin only)

User Profile & Badge Map (admin view of users + wristband ID)

🧑‍💼 User Panel View:
Can only view their own bookings and check-in history

Can book/release rooms and desks

View IAQ levels of currently booked space

See top alerts affecting them

Limited analytics (only their usage)

👩‍💼 Admin Panel View:
Can access all floor plans, all alerts

Manage users and device statuses

Edit room setups and monitor global IAQ

See full analytics + generate reports

💻 Tech Suggestion (Optional):
Build using React.js + Tailwind CSS, use Firebase (or dummy backend) to simulate real data operations, including CRUD, filtering, and validation. Apply animation using Framer Motion or GSAP if needed.

Please design and build this dashboard with sample data shown visually. The final output should look clean, modern, and production-ready, and reflect all the functionality and modules described above.
